# entrypoint.sh — cont-ai-nerd container entrypoint
# =========================================================================
# This script runs as root at container startup. It:
#
#   1. Reads path_map from /etc/cont-ai-nerd/config.json
#   2. Creates symlinks from host-side paths to their /workspace equivalents
#      so that OpenCode clients can use host-side paths as working directories
#   3. Drops privileges to the agent user
#   4. Execs opencode with the original arguments
#
# Why symlinks?
#   OpenCode clients (neovim plugin, TUI) connect with the host-side project
#   path (e.g., /home/alice/projects/foo). OpenCode uses this as the cwd for
#   shell commands. Without symlinks, this path doesn't exist inside the
#   container, causing posix_spawn to fail with ENOENT.
#
#   The symlinks create a minimal directory structure inside the container
#   (e.g., /home/alice/projects -> /workspace/projects) so that host-side
#   paths resolve correctly.
#
# Security:
#   - Intermediate directories (e.g., /home/alice) are owned by root:root
#     with mode 755. They contain nothing except the symlinks.
#   - The agent user can traverse these directories but cannot create files
#     or read anything that isn't part of the /workspace mount.
#
# Umask:
#   Sets umask 002 so agent-created files are 664 (group-writable) and
#   directories are 775. This ensures the primary user retains full access
#   to files the agent creates, via their shared group.
