# contain-tui — Interactive TUI for contain
# =========================================================================
# Attaches an interactive TUI to the running contain container.
# All data (auth, database, model preferences) is persisted via the
# container's read-write bind mounts — no separate container needed.
#
# Authentication via /connect works directly: the server handles credential
# storage through its API and writes auth.json to the mounted data directory.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo contain-tui              # Start interactive TUI
#   sudo contain-tui --session X  # Resume session X
#
# =========================================================================

# ── Check that the main container is running ─────────────────────────────
# Use systemctl is-active rather than `podman ps` because the container is
# managed as a rootful service; an unprivileged `podman ps` only sees the
# rootless namespace and would always report the container as not running.

# Run as the agent user (not root) so that files the TUI writes (model.json,
# prompt history, etc.) are owned by agent:primary_group and group-writable.
# The XDG variables ensure OpenCode resolves its config/data/state paths to
# the agent's home, matching the bind-mounted host directories.
# umask 002 mirrors the entrypoint's umask so new files are 664/dirs 775.
